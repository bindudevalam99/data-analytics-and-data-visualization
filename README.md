This data contains day wise weather attributes from 2022 to July 2033 (predicted data)
Columns are as follows :

Date	Average temperature (°F)
Average humidity (%)	Average dewpoint (°F)
Average barometer (in)	Average windspeed (mph)
Average gust speed (mph)	Average direction (°degree)
Rainfall for month (in)	Rainfall for year (in)
Maximum rain per minute	Maximum temperature (°F)
Minimum temperature (°F)	Maximum humidity (%)
Minimum humidity (%)	Maximum pressure
Minimum pressure	Maximum wind speed (mph)
Maximum gust speed (mph)	Maximum heat index (°F)

NOTE:the given data requires cleaning and analysis to proceed further for any analysis.

The Project will consist of 2 modules:

Module 1: Pre-processing, Analysing data using Python and SQL.
In this module, you will query the dataset using structured query language to gain insights from the database. 
The problem statements to be solved will be provided to you and you need to provide the solution for the same using your logic. 
Different concepts of SQL will be used in this process, such as aggregating the data, grouping the data, ordering the data, etc.

Module 2: Visualizing data using Power BI:
You will use the weather datasets and the data table you created to visualize what the numbers in and behind the data want to convey. 
You have to create a dashboard for the same using different statistical graphs and diagrams for a visual understanding and analysis.
